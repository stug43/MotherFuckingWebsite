<h1>This is MY motherfucking website.</h1>

<aside>Did you really think i could bite someone else production?</aside>

<h2>Moreover, it poses an intellectual property issue, don't you think so?</h2>

<p>Whatever, this kind of website is a real website for real guys, I mean for guys appreciating the real things, like real talk whithout any useless CSS skills making little boys say: "Oh my god it's beautiful!". All you need is here even if you don't recognize it :</p>

<ul>
<li>Unordonate list, because ordonates one are for those who can't do it themselves</li>
<li>Black letters in a white background</li>
<li>An amazing style sense, that makes your mother jealeous</li>
<li>Some useless shitty sentences for motherfuckers</li>
<li>Differents text formating</li>
</ul>

<h3>Well, well, well...</h3>

<p>I won't spend hours talking about why my website is the website everyone was looking for, but count on your intelligence to realize. If you are blind you already realized (what tends to prove that blind people are more discerning that others but it is another subject).</p>

<h2>No millions of bits for quite nothing</h2>

<p>No useless pic to disturb you from the overwhelming truth, no special policies you have to download from the other edge of the internet, do you finally get it?<br />
This website is made for you and no care for your expensive PCI express x16 graphic card</p>

<h2>It is fucking responsive</h2>

<p>Come on girls, did you really think I was ruthless? I care of you, I swear! you can read this lines on your screen whatever its size. On your giant screen plugged to your xbox one? No problem. On the ridiculous screen of your little sister's motorola phone? No problem. Do you see what I mean?</p>

<h2>--> It works</h2>

<p>And that is beautiful... This website has nothing to envy to others. It is self sufficient (uuuh, almost for its navigator browser need but you got what I said).</p>

<p>Even IE6 appreciate not being marginalized, ask it!</p>

<h2>So are you satisfied, you motherfucker?</h2>

<p>if you don't you should have a serious problem, because you just saw your perfect motherfucking website, the only one made for you</p>
<blockquote>To end this shit, why not a quote?<br />
- myself</blockquote>

<h2>Most beautiful footer you will ever see</h2>
